# About me
My Name is Phi.
I love Excel and automation.

I have no experience nor knowledge about programming before. That's why as soon as I heard about Visual Basic Application (``VBA``), I knew right away that was the most ideal time to start with programming.

Currently, I'm still learning ``VBA``. Hopefully, this will set a solid foundation for me to step further into the world of programming.
