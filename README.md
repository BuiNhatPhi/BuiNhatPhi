# Hello World
I love Excel and automation.

I had no experience nor knowledge about programming before. 
That's why as soon as I heard that Excel has the thing called Visual Basic Application (``VBA``), I knew right away that was the most ideal time to learn writing some codes. 

Currently, I'm still learning ``VBA``. I hope ``VBA`` will set a solid foundation for me to step further into the world of programming.
