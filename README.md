# About me
My Name is Phi.
I love Excel and automation.

That's why as soon as I know about Visual Basic Application (`VBA`), I try to implement ``VBA`` into my works.

I have no experience nor knowledge about programming before that. Therefore, ``VBA`` was a wild and fun experience for me.

As of right now, I'm still learning `VBA`. Hopefully, this will set a solid foundation for me to step further into the world of programming.
